- [Serre](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/systems-of-conservation-laws-1/3E00C5069ED34D5ABBE72626A44EAB2A): A bit more approachable, also focused entirely on theory
- [Hesthaven](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611975109.fm): More up-to-date and gives a broader approach to a range of high-order numerical methods
